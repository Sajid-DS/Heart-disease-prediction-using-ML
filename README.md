About this project:

Heart disease (HD) is one of the most common diseases nowadays,
and an early diagnosis of such a disease is a crucial task for many health care providers 
to prevent their patients for such a disease and to save lives. I applied different classifier to 
predict the correct result and i found logisticregression is giving best results.
